This plugin changes the default order of queries generating posts from descending to ascending.

== Description ==

Be default, the sort order for queries in WordPressis descending.  This will produce posts in reverse chronological order, the desired result for most blogs.  However, in some cases it may be desirable to have posts in ascending order.  This plugin changes the default order from descending to ascending.  This affects all queries (home page, archives, dates, etc).


== Installation ==

1. Upload 'default_sort_ascend.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
